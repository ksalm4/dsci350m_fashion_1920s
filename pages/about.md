## About CollectionBuilder-Sheets

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-Sheets](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-sheets), a template  for creating simple digital exhibit websites by loading collection metadata directly from a CSV, designed for teaching digital library skills and easy hosting on GitHub Pages.

Using CB-Sheets, it is possible to use a live Google Sheets spreadsheet for your collection metadata, allowing you to see the outcome of metadata edits update immediately.
This enables active collaboration to prototype collections with minimal set up.

## Create your own Metadata

To create metadata compatible with this CollectionBuilder-Sheets instance the best way to get started is to make of copy of our template in Google Drive:

[CollectionBuilder Metadata Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Uv9ytll0hysMOH1j-VL1lZx6PWvc1zf3L35sK_4IuzI/copy?usp=sharing){:.btn .btn-outline-primary target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
{:.text-center}

Alternatively, you can [download the template CSV]({{ '/assets/metadata-template.csv' | relative_url }}) and work on your local machine.
We suggest editing your CSV using [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) Calc, [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/), or Google Sheets (and do not suggest using Excel, since Excel's CSV output is not correctly formatted).

Describe your items in your copy of the template, following the [Metadata Guidelines]({{ '/metadata.html' | relative_url }}). 

Once you have items added you can test your metadata by clicking the "Change the Metadata" button above.
