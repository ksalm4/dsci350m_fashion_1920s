# **Data Management Plan**

## Project Description

Our project on 1920s women’s fashion including clothing items, magazine pages, and advertisements highlight fashion trends from over a century ago, intriguing fashion connoisseurs, fashion companies, movie production companies, historians, people involved in creative industries for educational and creative endeavors, and an interested public. This audience can reference this collection to help produce essays, books, articles, movies, television shows, and music videos.   
This collection includes university, museum, and library archives to showcase fashion, magazines, and advertisements from the 1920s. This includes shoes, gloves, dresses, hats, bags, swimsuits, magazine pages, and advertisements that were found using the Digital Public Library of America’s, New York Public Library’s, Smithsonian’s, and Cornell University’s online archive. This project includes a variety of different pieces that were collected and put on a public GitHub repository and displayed through CollectionBuilder. 

## Personnel, Roles & Responsibilities

Sydney Wolfe serves as the project manager and is responsible for our written content and the quality of our data.   
Rachel Kesich serves as the repository manager and is responsible for organizing data from the Google Sheets onto our GitHub site.   
Kira Salm serves as the collections manager and is responsible for organizing metadata on Google Sheets, which includes images, sources, coordinates, and file names. 
If someone leaves the group, the plan is to divide the work they provided evenly among the remaining group members.


## Expected Data

Our data includes downloaded jpegs which are uploaded to the GitHub site. We collaborated on a shared Google Sheets file to organize our sources. We also maintained communication via email and saved our Google documents including our project description in a Google Drive. The GitHub and Collections Builder page will be shared with others to help display the jpegs and descriptions of the pieces to highlight fashion trends from the 1920s, but the google sheet of collected data and google documents will only be shared if requested and the emails, although may be kept, will not be shared due to researchers' privacy. 

## Period of Data Retention

This data should be at least maintained until the last person involved in this project graduates from the University of Oregon most likely at the end of Winter Term of 2026\.
